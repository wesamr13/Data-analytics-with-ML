using the filter method on the logistic regression model for the customer bank churn.

Steps:
Load the dataset into a pandas dataframe.
Split the data into features (X) and target (y).
Apply feature selection using a filter method such as Variance Threshold or Correlation Matrix.
Train the logistic regression model on the selected features.
Evaluate the performance of the model using metrics such as accuracy, precision, recall, or f1-score.

python code:

import pandas as pd
from sklearn.feature_selection import VarianceThreshold
from sklearn.linear_model import LogisticRegression
from sklearn.model_selection import train_test_split
from sklearn.metrics import accuracy_score

# Load the data into a pandas dataframe
df = pd.read_csv("bank_customer_churn.csv")

# Split the data into features and target
X = df.drop("Churn", axis=1)
y = df["Churn"]

# Apply Variance Threshold feature selection
selector = VarianceThreshold()
X_selected = selector.fit_transform(X)

# Split the data into training and testing sets
X_train, X_test, y_train, y_test = train_test_split(X_selected, y, test_size=0.2)

# Train the logistic regression model
clf = LogisticRegression()
clf.fit(X_train, y_train)

# Make predictions on the test data
y_pred = clf.predict(X_test)

# Evaluate the accuracy of the model
accuracy = accuracy_score(y_test, y_pred)
print("Accuracy:", accuracy)
